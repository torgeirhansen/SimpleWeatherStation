# Simple Weather Station

This is based on the ms-iot WeatherStation project, the distinction is that I use a raspberry with the weather shield as as sensor outside, and another raspberry with a touchscreen that I've fastened to my fridge door that shows the data from the ouside sensor.
Currently it only shows the temperature, and I have a not-well-working graph of the last 24hours (its slow and not very useful).

The wife wants it to also show the local weather forecast, so that might be coming soon :)
